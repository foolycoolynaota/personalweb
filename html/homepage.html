    		<li> Just So You Know
    		<p>Hi! I'm Yakki and I am a junior developer in training. This webpage is everything that I have learned and am going to learn over the next few weeks or so. Currently coding is not my strongest suit since I am still a bit green on the subject, but one thing I have learned is that it can be very useful. Without it the internet would probably be a hot mess. So far I only know the basics and the nitpicking of different languages but I promised myself by the end of the month this webpage is going to look great!</p>
        
        <p>This page wa< created using HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS and will change perodically to make room for new features and links.</p>
